<p>While he may not be in the Hall of Fame and is one of the most controversial players in baseball history you can not talk about other Reds Hall of Famers without talking about Pete Rose. Pete Rose was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1941. Rose made his debut with the Reds in 1963 against the Pirates. He struggled in his first couple games but he turned things around quickly and would be named the National League Rookie of the Year. Pete was a great player in the 60s but his career took off in the 70s. In 1971 the Reds dominated the National League and they would capture four pennants and two World Series championships from 1970-1976. Pete would serve as the leadoff hitter for the Big Red Machine and led the team with his desire to win.</p> 

<p>In 1978 he would become a free agent and sign with the Philidelphia Phillies who he would win a World Series with in 1980. Rose would then have a short stint with the Expos in 1984 but, he would be traded back to the Reds where he would become player-manager. On September, 11, 1985 Rose would get his 4,192nd hit against the Padres to give him the mosts hits by a player in baseball history. In 1989 allegations arose that he had bet on major-league games which is one of the leagues most sacred rules. Rose was found guilty and was banned from baseball for life which led to him being unable to be in Cooperstown unless the MLB decides to let him in. Pete rose unfortunately passed away in 2024 at the age of 83. While Pete Rose had plenty of controversy off the field he is one of the most important players in Reds history and will forever be one of the best baseball players in history.</p>
